# How to visualize tree decompositions

## Overview
* all graphs on one continuous page, which is scrollable like a photo album
* each graph is spatially visualized in a special rectangle
* one graph per row
* each graph has a name
* clicking on a graph leads to a new page, that is dedicated to this one graph

The graph page shows the graph itself and its tree decompositions.

## Graph itself
* name of the graph
* number of vertices
* number of edges
* the graph itself spatially visualized in a special rectangle
* can drag my view on the graph by clicking on empty space
* can scroll my view to and from the graph
* can drag vertices around
* each vertex is labelled with its id
* can click on a vertex to highlight this vertex and all its edges

## The graph's tree decompositions
* listed row-wise below the graph, one tree decomposition per row
* each tree decomposition has a name, which could indicate the used algorithm
* each tree decomposition is spatially visualized in a special rectangle
* can drag my view on the tree decomposition by clicking on empty space
* can scroll my view to and from the tree decomposition
* can drag nodes around
* each node is labelled with its bag content
* can click on a node to highlight this node and all its edges
* each tree decomposition has a treewidth and a joinwidth
* each tree decomposition has a list of runtimes, which a new invocation of the indicated algorithm used to compute it
