# Tree Decompositions: Minimizing the Size of Join Nodes

There are graphs. A graphs can be decomposed in a tree-like manner. Then the whole graph is the root of this tree and parts of this graph are the children of this root. Then it goes down to the leaves, which only contain a few vertices of the graph.

Certain tree-like decompositions are called **tree decompositions**. They have several properties, the most important of all being their **width**. In this thesis, I analyze a slightly different, though width-related, property of tree decompositions. I compute tree decompositions taking special care to optimize this property on a certain set of example graphs from two [PACE competitions](https://pacechallenge.org/).
